Consent Web Services
====================

This is a dropwizard module for the Consent Web Services API.

Some documentation for the initial version of this service is available in 
docs/ConsentServicesAPIv1.pdf

The API defines a few basic methods, including CREATE, READ, and UPDATE methods for consent documents.
```
PUT /consent
GET /consent/{id}
POST /consent/{id}
```
