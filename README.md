## Data Use Oversight System

A semi-automated management service for compliant secondary use of human genomics data
There are restrictions on researching human genomics data. For example: “Data can only be used for breast cancer research with non-commercial purpose”.
The Data Use Oversight system ensures that researchers using genomics data honor these restrictions.

See [consent/DEVNOTES.md](DEVNOTES.md) to run locally.
