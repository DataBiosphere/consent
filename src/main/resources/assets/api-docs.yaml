            Internal Collaborators are defined as individuals not under the direct supervision of the
            PO's research project involving controlled-access data subject to the NIH GDS Policy.
            They are employees of the requesting PI's institution and work at the same location/campus
            as the PI. Internal Collaborators must be at the PI or equivalent level and are required
            to have a Library Card in order to access data through this request. Internal
            Collaborators will have Data Downloader/Approval status so that they may add their own
            relevant Internal Lab Staff. Internal Collaborators will not be required to submit an
            independent DAR to collaborate on this project.
