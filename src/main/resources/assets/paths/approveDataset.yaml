  summary: DAC Chair updates dataset approval status
  description: |
    Endpoint allows DAC Chairs to submit approval decisions for datasets under their purview (or requested purview).
    The request will succeed if dataset has not yet been approved and the user has access to the dataset as a Chairperson.
    The request will fail if the dataset is already approved, the request body (payload) is invalid, or if the user does not have access to the dataset as a Chairperson.
