  summary: Update a limited set of user fields
  description: |
    Updates the user identified by the ID. Requires the authenticated user to have the same id as that of the user being updated except in the admin case - admins can update information for other users. A user's email cannot be updated. 
    * The following fields can be updated via this endpoint
      * Display Name
      * Institution Id
      * Email Preference
    * Users with the "Signing Official" are not permitted to change their institution. Such calls will result in a "Bad Request". "Signing Official" users are, however, allowed to save their
        institution if it is not already set.
