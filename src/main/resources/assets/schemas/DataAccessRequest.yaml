      External Collaborators are not employees of the Requesting PI's institution and/or do not
      work at the same location as the PI, and consequently must be independently approved to
      access controlled-access data subject to the GDS Policy. External Collaborators must be
      at the PI or equivalent level and are not required to have a  Library Card in order to
      access data, although it is encouraged. Note, External Collaborators must submit an
      independant DAR approved by their Signing Official to collaborate on this project.
      External Collaborators will be able to add their Lab Staff, as needed, via their
      independent DAR. Approval of this DAR does not indicate approval of the External
      Collaborators listed.

      Internal Collaborators are defined as individuals not under the direct supervision of the
      PO's research project involving controlled-access data subject to the NIH GDS Policy.
      They are employees of the requesting PI's institution and work at the same location/campus
      as the PI. Internal Collaborators must be at the PI or equivalent level and are required
      to have a Library Card in order to access data through this request. Internal
      Collaborators will have Data Downloader/Approval status so that they may add their own
      relevant Internal Lab Staff. Internal Collaborators will not be required to submit an
      independent DAR to collaborate on this project.
