  "rus": "Recent \"genome-wide association studies\" (GWAS) and their meta-analysis have identified numerous common genetic variants associated with coronary artery disease (CAD)/myocardial infarction (MI) risk. However, these variants can explain only a small proportion of the heritable risk for the disease (\"missing heritability\" issue). Meanwhile there is growing evidence that multi-loci interactions, including epistasis, may contribute to genetic explanation for CAD/MI risk but have not been unveiled yet. Compared to GWAS studies which test the associations of single common SNPs to the disease, multi-locus association analyses aim to test the effect of combinations for two or more SNPs. Accessing and mining the individual-level genotype data together with CAD-related phenotype information will help us to further investigate the genetic etiology of CAD. This dbGaP dataset will be analyzed independently and will be used only for research purposes. These data will not be used to determine the individual identity or family members within pedigree structures. In all cases, the datasets will be used to understand the genetics of CAD/MI.\n",
